# Visual-Cryptography-using-K-n-Share-Alogritm using MATLAB
Problem Statement - 
In today's computer generation, data security, hiding and all such activities have become probably the most important aspect for most organizations. These organizations spend millions of their currency to just secure their data. This urgency has risen due to increase in cyber theft/ crime. The technology has grown so much that criminals have found multiple ways to perform cybercrime to which the concerned authorities have either less or not sufficient answer to counter

Visual cryptography is an encryption technique that decomposes secret images into multiple shares. These shares are digitally or physically overlapped to recover the original image, negating the need for complex mathematical operations or additional hardware.

It is a category of secret sharing where a secret image is divided into n images called as shares. Each share is a random binary pattern which is printed onto transparencies and distributed among n participants. When any k of the n transparencies of the shares are superimposed then the secret image can be perfectly reconstructed, while even complete knowledge of (kâ€“1) shares reveals absolutely no information about the secret image.


In this project we take any image which is to be shared secretly. This image is encrypted using a key given by the user. Further, the encrypted image is divided into N different shares using K N Secret Sharing Algorithm. These N shares can be distributed but, the end user needs only K of these shares to generate the original image. After the original image is generated it is still in encrypted form. The key which is used to encrypt the image originally is now required again to decrypt it, thus providing an additional level of security.
